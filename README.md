PC-based mobile robot built in the early 2000s.

Started as an Evolution Robotics ER1. Was my first PC-based and aluminium constructed robot. The reliance on the ER1 software and control module to bridge things between the PC and microcontroller ultimately proved to be its downfall. A loose wire grounded itself through the metal frame and destroyed a small capacitor in said control unit, for which Evolution Robotics was no longer manufacturing replacements. This experience played a role in my decision to switch to open source for everything.
